# Abalone Age Prediction

## Project Overview

This project aims to predict the age of abalones based on various physical measurements. The age of an abalone is determined by cutting the shell through the cone, staining it, and counting the number of rings
through a microscope -- a boring and time-consuming task. Our goal is to predict the age using machine learning techniques, thus making the process faster and more efficient.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It includes measurements such as length, diameter, height, whole weight, shucked weight, viscera weight, shell weight, and gender.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Usage

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/13Gitanjali/abalone-age-prediction.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd abalone-age-prediction`
3. Install the requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Run the main script: `python main.py`

## Results

The results of the project will be updated here once the model training is complete.
